# Melanie's Domain Tracker

Goal: Track domains I own and their intended use. I created this to keep me honest when I noticed that I owned a lot of domains but wasn't shipping anything. Hopefully over time the "todo" list will get smaller (either I will ship the project or not renew the domain name) and the "shipped" list will get bigger!
