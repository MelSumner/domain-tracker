# Melanie's Domain Tracker

Goal: Track domains I own and their intended use. I created this to keep me honest when I noticed that I owned a lot of domains but wasn't shipping anything. Hopefully over time the "todo" list will get smaller (either I will ship the project or not renew the domain name) and the "shipped" list will get bigger! 

## Projects todo

  - I wanted to track the way we thought things were gonna go when we first started writing code for the web, and do some visualization on the kind of websites we imagined having
- wwwdotcomdot.com
  - seemed funny at the time
